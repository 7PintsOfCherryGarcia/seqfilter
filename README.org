* Seqfilter
Seqfilter is a small tool written in C on top of the excellent
[[https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib][klib]] library by Heng Li. It allows filtering of fasta and fastq files
based on sequence IDs and sequence length. The fasta and fastq input
files may be gzipped.

* Get it!
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./git clone --recursive https://github.com/clwgg/seqfilter

cd seqfilter
make
#+END_SRC

* Usage
Seqfilter will *always* try to filter by IDs, since thats its intended purpose.
You *can* however omit the ID file. In that case, you *have* to specify the '-n' flag
for negative filtering if you want to produce output, to allow output
of sequences without a "valid" ID.

Negative filtering ('-n') means that all sequences *without* ID
matches are kept (subsequently, if no ID file is supplied, all
sequences are without ID matches).

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# filter by ID file
seqfilter -i in.fq -l ids.txt -o out.fq

#filter by ID file and min length 30
seqfilter -m 30 -i in.fq -l ids.txt -o out.fq

#filter only by min length 30
seqfilter -n -m 30 -i in.fq -o out.fq

#keep only sequence called "mt"
seqfilter -i in.fa -l <(printf "mt\n") -o mt.fa

#remove sequence called "mt" from input
seqfilter -n -i in.fa -l <(printf "mt\n") -o in_no-mt.fa

#+END_SRC
